# Linux-str_replace

This project was forked from the following Github repository: [Linux-str_replace](https://github.com/Samer-Al-iraqi/Linux-str_replace), because the raw script file is used directly from my projects:
* [my-servers](https://github.com/ganagus/my-servers)

Thanks @Samir-Al-iraqi for the script, because it solved my problem when trying to replace a substring within a file, in which I could't solve it using sed and perl commands.
